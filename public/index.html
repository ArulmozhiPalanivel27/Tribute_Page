      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar (/ˌsʌtʃɪn tɛnˈduːlkər/ (About this soundlisten); born 24 April 1973) is a former<br>
        international cricketer from India and a former captain of the Indian national team. He is widely regarded as
        one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.[5] He is the highest run scorer of all time in
        International cricket.<br><br> Considered as the world's most prolific batsman of all time,[6] he is the only player to
        have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in a One Day
        International (ODI), the holder of the record for the most runs in both Test and ODI cricket, and the only
        player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket<br>
        Tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in<br>
        Karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close<br>
        to twenty-four years.</p>
